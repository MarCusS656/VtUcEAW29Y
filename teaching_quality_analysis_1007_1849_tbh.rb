# teaching_quality_analysis.rb
# This Ruby on Rails program analyzes teaching quality based on provided data.
# 增强安全性

require 'active_record'
require 'sqlite3'

# Database configuration
# 优化算法效率
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'sqlite3',
  :database => 'teaching_quality.db'
)

# Define a model for Teachers
class Teacher < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Association: a teacher can have many evaluations
  has_many :evaluations
# FIXME: 处理边界情况
end

# Define a model for Evaluations
class Evaluation < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Association: an evaluation belongs to a teacher

# Service class for Teaching Quality Analysis
# 扩展功能模块
class TeachingQualityAnalysis
  # Constructor to initialize with teacher data
