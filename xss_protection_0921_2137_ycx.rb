# xss_protection.rb
#
# This Ruby on Rails program provides basic XSS protection functionality.
# It includes escaping of user input to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

require 'rails'

class XssProtectionController < ApplicationController
  # This action simulates a user input scenario where a user submits a form with content.
  # It then escapes the user input to prevent XSS attacks.
  def protect
    # Get user input from the request parameters
    user_input = params[:user_input]
    
    # Check if user input is present
    if user_input.blank?
      flash[:error] = 'No input provided.'
      render :protect
    else
      # Escape the user input to prevent XSS attacks
      safe_input = escape_input(user_input)
      
      # Render the result with the escaped input
      render plain: "Input escaped: #{safe_input}"
    end

  # This method takes raw user input and escapes it using Rails' built-in sanitization methods.
  # It's used to prevent XSS attacks by sanitizing the input before displaying it.
  def escape_input(raw_input)
    # Use Rails' `strip_tags` method to remove any HTML tags from the input
    # This is a simple example and might need to be expanded depending on the specific use case
    ActionController::Base.helpers.strip_tags(raw_input)
