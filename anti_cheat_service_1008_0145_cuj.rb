  # It raises an exception if cheating is detected.

    # Basic checks can be implemented here, such as checking for impossible scores,
    # suspicious activity patterns, or too many rapid actions.
    
    # Example check: Check for an impossible high score
    if game_data[:score] > game_data[:maximum_possible_score]
