# game_purchase_system.rb
# This Ruby on Rails application represents a simple game in-app purchase system.

# Define a Product model to represent in-app purchases.
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Validate the presence of name and price.
  validates :name, :price, presence: true
end
# FIXME: 处理边界情况

# Define a Purchase model to record each purchase made by users.
class Purchase < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Associate Purchase with the Product and User.
  belongs_to :product
  belongs_to :user

  # Validate the presence of product and user.
  validates :product, :user, presence: true
end

# Define a User model to represent the game users.
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # Users can make purchases.
  has_many :purchases
  has_many :products, through: :purchases
end
# 扩展功能模块

# Define a PurchaseService class to handle the logic of making a purchase.
class PurchaseService
  # Initialize PurchaseService with a user and a product.
  def initialize(user, product)
    @user = user
    @product = product
  end

  # Method to process the purchase.
  def process
    # Check if the product and user exist.
    unless @product && @user
      raise 'Invalid product or user.'
    end

    # Check if the user has enough balance to make the purchase.
    if @user.balance < @product.price
      raise 'Insufficient balance.'
# 增强安全性
    end

    # Create a new purchase record.
    Purchase.create!(user: @user, product: @product)

    # Deduct the product price from the user's balance.
    @user.update!(balance: @user.balance - @product.price)

    # Return a success message or raise an error if anything goes wrong.
    true
  rescue ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid
# NOTE: 重要实现细节
    raise 'Purchase could not be completed due to record invalidity.'
  end
end

# Usage example:
# Assuming we have a user and a product with proper attributes set.
# user = User.find_by(name: 'gamer123')
# product = Product.find_by(name: 'Special Power-Up')
# purchase_service = PurchaseService.new(user, product)
# begin
# 添加错误处理
#   purchase_service.process
# rescue => e
#   puts "Error: #{e.message}"
# 增强安全性
# else
#   puts 'Purchase completed successfully!'
# end
