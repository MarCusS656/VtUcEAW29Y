# feature_engineering_tool.rb
# This Ruby script acts as a simple feature engineering tool within the Rails framework.
# It demonstrates best practices, error handling, and is commented for maintainability and extensibility.

# FeatureEngineeringTool is a module that can be included in any model where feature engineering is needed.
module FeatureEngineeringTool
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern
  
  # This method is an example of a feature engineering process.
  # It takes a dataset and applies transformations to extract features.
  def self.transform_features(dataset)
    # Error handling for nil or empty dataset
    raise ArgumentError, 'Dataset cannot be nil or empty' if dataset.blank?
    
    # Example transformation: Extracting a new feature that is the sum of two existing features.
    transformed_dataset = dataset.map do |data_point|
      next if data_point['feature1'].blank? || data_point['feature2'].blank?
      data_point['new_feature'] = data_point['feature1'] + data_point['feature2']
      data_point
    end.compact
    
    # You can add more transformations here as needed.

# Example usage within a Rails model:
# class DataModel < ApplicationRecord
#   include FeatureEngineeringTool
#  
#   def self.process_features
#     dataset = self.all.pluck(:feature1, :feature2) # Assuming the model has feature1 and feature2
#     transformed_data = transform_features(dataset)
#     # Do something with the transformed data, e.g., save it back to the database or use it for analysis.
#   end
